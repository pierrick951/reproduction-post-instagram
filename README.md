# Insta Reproduction

This project aims to create a mini React component simulating a functional Instagram post, with the goal of mastering the concept of components before tackling something larger.

***Tasks***

- The heart should be fillable in red ❤️ and the save icon in gold 💛.
- A mini burger menu 🍔 should also be integrated as shown in the model.
- The number of likes should increment or decrement based on whether the heart is red or not.
- Clicking "see more" should be functional.
- Users should be able to leave a comment, which will appear on the screen under the post (without refreshing the page).

Good luck to myself! 💪
